## Project Overview

### Project Goals

This project is a website for Inia Biosciences built using Next.js, a React framework. The goal is to create a modern, responsive website that showcases Inia's work and services. This project is being developed as part of the CS410 Intro to Software Engineering course, providing hands-on experience with real-world software development practices and teamwork.

- Create a professional, responsive website for INIA
- Learn modern web development frameworks and tools
- Practice collaborative software development using Git
- Apply software engineering best practices and Agile principles
- Learn to work as a team using modern collaboration tools

### What is This Project?

If you're completely new to web development, here's what you need to know:

- We're building a website using modern technologies
- The website will be interactive and work well on all devices (phones, tablets, computers)
- We'll be working as a team, with each person contributing different parts
- We'll be following Agile development principles with regular sprints and standups
- The project gives us hands-on experience with real-world software development
- The final product will be a professional website that Inia can actually use

### Development Methodology

We will be using **Agile methodology** for this project:

- **Iterative Development**: We'll work in short "sprints" (typically 1-2 weeks) to deliver working features incrementally
- **Daily Standups**: Quick daily check-ins where each team member shares what they're working on
- **Sprint Planning**: At the beginning of each sprint, we'll decide what features to work on next
- **Sprint Reviews**: At the end of each sprint, we'll demo completed features and get feedback
- **Continuous Improvement**: We'll regularly reflect on how to improve our process

This approach helps us adapt to changes, deliver value regularly, and maintain high-quality code throughout the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)

  - This is the JavaScript runtime that powers our project
  - Download and install it from the official website
  - To check if it's installed, open your terminal or command prompt and type: `node --version`

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (We use pnpm instead of npm for this project)

  - pnpm is a package manager, similar to npm but faster and more efficient
  - To install pnpm, run: `npm install -g pnpm`
  - To check if it's installed correctly, run: `pnpm --version`

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

  - Git is a version control system that helps us track changes and collaborate
  - Download and install it from the official website
  - To check if it's installed, run: `git --version`

- A code editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
  - VS Code is a free, powerful code editor that works well with JavaScript
  - After installing, open VS Code and navigate to the Extensions tab (or press Ctrl+Shift+X)
  - Install recommended extensions listed in the next section

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Setting up Git (one-time setup)

If this is your first time using Git, you'll need to configure it:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

#### 2. Clone the repository

"Cloning" means downloading a copy of the project to your computer:

```bash
# Navigate to where you want to store the project
# For example:
# On Windows: cd C:\Projects
# On Mac/Linux: cd ~/Projects

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/INIABiosciences/inia.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd inia
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

Dependencies are external libraries and tools our project needs to work:

```bash
# Install all the project dependencies
pnpm install
```

This might take a few minutes. It's normal to see a lot of text scrolling by.

#### 4. Create a new branch for your work

```bash
# First, make sure you have the latest testing branch
git checkout testing
git pull

# Then create your feature branch (replace "your-feature-name" with a descriptive name)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

#### 5. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

After running this command:

1. Wait for the server to start (you'll see some messages in the terminal)
2. Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:3000
3. You should see the website running locally on your computer

Congratulations! You've successfully set up the project! ðŸŽ‰

### Setting Up Your Code Editor

We recommend using Visual Studio Code with the following extensions to enhance your development experience:

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to the Extensions tab (or press Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for and install these extensions:

- **ESLint**: For real-time linting feedback (shows errors and warnings as you type)
- **Prettier**: For code formatting (makes your code look nice and consistent)
- **JavaScript and TypeScript Intellisense**: For improved code suggestions
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**: For Tailwind CSS class suggestions
- **GitLens**: For enhanced Git capabilities (see who changed what and when)

Recommended VS Code settings (create or edit `.vscode/settings.json` in the project):

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "eslint.validate": ["javascript", "javascriptreact"],
  "files.autoSave": "onFocusChange"
}
```

To create this file:

1. In VS Code, open the project folder
2. Create a new folder called `.vscode` if it doesn't exist
3. Inside that folder, create a file called `settings.json`
4. Copy and paste the above JSON into that file
5. Save the file

### Common Setup Issues

#### Node.js Installation Problems

- **Windows**: If you see "node is not recognized" errors, you may need to restart your computer after installation
- **Mac**: If you installed Node.js but terminal doesn't recognize it, try closing and reopening your terminal

#### pnpm Installation Issues

- If you see "pnpm is not recognized" errors, make sure you installed it globally: `npm install -g pnpm`
- Try closing and reopening your terminal after installing

#### Git Clone Errors

- If you get "permission denied" errors, make sure you have a GitHub account and are logged in
- If you get "SSL certificate problem" errors, your network might be blocking secure connections. Try:
  ```bash
  git config --global http.sslVerify false
  ```
  (Note: This is not recommended for security reasons, but might help in educational environments)

#### Dependency Installation Errors

- If `pnpm install` fails, try deleting the `node_modules` folder (if it exists) and running it again
- Make sure your internet connection is stable during installation

## Development Workflow

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

What this does:

1. Starts a local web server on your computer
2. Automatically reloads the page when you make changes to the code
3. Shows errors in the browser and terminal if something goes wrong

Other useful commands:

- `pnpm build` - Builds the app for production (creates optimized files)
- `pnpm start` - Runs the built app in production mode (after building)
- `pnpm lint` - Runs ESLint to check for code issues
- `pnpm format` - Formats all files using Prettier

  - Optimizes images and other assets automatically

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces

  - Allows us to create reusable components
  - Makes it easy to update only the parts of a page that change

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling

  - Provides pre-built styling classes
  - Makes responsive design easier (looks good on all screen sizes)

- **ESLint**: Tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code

  - Helps catch errors before they cause problems
  - Enforces consistent coding style

- **Prettier**: Code formatter to maintain consistent code style

  - Automatically formats code to look consistent
  - Saves time and prevents style disagreements

- **Husky**: Git hooks to enforce code quality before commits

  - Runs tests and checks before allowing code to be committed
  - Helps prevent broken code from being added to the project

- **Sanity CMS**: Headless content management system
  - Provides a user-friendly interface for managing website content
  - Separates content from code, making it easier to update content without code changes
  - Allows content editors to work independently from developers
  - Provides a structured approach to content modeling

### Sanity CMS

#### What is Sanity CMS?

Sanity is a "headless" content management system (CMS), which means it separates the content management from the presentation layer. This makes it perfect for our Next.js website:

- **Content Editors** can focus on creating and managing content through a user-friendly interface
- **Developers** can focus on building the website and fetching content from Sanity using APIs
- **Both** can work independently, improving workflow efficiency

The Sanity ecosystem consists of two main parts:

1. **Sanity Studio**: A customizable content editing environment (what we integrate into our project)
2. **Content Lake**: A real-time database where all your content is stored securely in the cloud

#### Project Setup

Our project already has Sanity integrated with the following structure:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                  # Next.js app directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ studio/          # Route for accessing Sanity Studio (/studio)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [[...index]]/# Catch-all route for Sanity Studio
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ page.jsx # Studio component
â”œâ”€â”€ sanity/              # Sanity configuration and schemas
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/             # Sanity utility functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schemaTypes/     # Content models/schemas
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ env.js           # Environment variables setup
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ structure.js     # Studio structure customization
â”œâ”€â”€ sanity.cli.js        # Sanity CLI config
â””â”€â”€ sanity.config.js     # Main Sanity config
```

#### Accessing Sanity Studio

The Sanity Studio is accessible at `http://localhost:3000/studio` when running the development server. This is where you'll:

1. Create and edit content
2. Manage media assets
3. Review content changes
4. Publish content to make it available on the live site

To access Sanity Studio:

```bash
# Start the development server
pnpm dev

# Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/studio
```

You'll need to log in with your Sanity account the first time.

#### Content Modeling with Schemas

Sanity uses schemas to define the structure of your content. Think of schemas as blueprints for your content - they define what fields a content type has, validation rules, and relationships between content.

All schema files are located in the `sanity/schemaTypes` directory.

**Example: Creating a Simple Schema**

Let's say you want to add a "Team Member" content type:

1. Create a new file in `sanity/schemaTypes/teamMember.js`:

```javascript
export default {
  name: "teamMember",
  title: "Team Member",
  type: "document",
  fields: [
    {
      name: "name",
      title: "Name",
      type: "string",
      validation: (Rule) => Rule.required(),
    },
    {
      name: "role",
      title: "Role",
      type: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "image",
      title: "Profile Image",
      type: "image",
      options: {
        hotspot: true, // Enables image crop controls
      },
    },
    {
      name: "bio",
      title: "Bio",
      type: "array",
      of: [{ type: "block" }], // Rich text editor
    },
  ],
  preview: {
    select: {
      title: "name",
      subtitle: "role",
      media: "image",
    },
  },
};
```

2. Register the schema in `sanity/schemaTypes/index.js`:

```javascript
// Import your schema
import teamMember from "./teamMember";

// Export all schemas
export const schemaTypes = [
  // ... other existing schemas
  teamMember,
];
```

3. Save the files and restart the development server
4. Go to Sanity Studio (http://localhost:3000/studio) and you'll see a new "Team Member" document type

#### Common Schema Field Types

Here are some common field types you can use in your schemas:

- `string`: For short text (names, titles, etc.)
- `text`: For longer text blocks without formatting
- `array` with `of: [{type: 'block'}]`: For rich text with formatting
- `image`: For image uploads
- `file`: For file uploads (PDFs, etc.)
- `boolean`: For yes/no options
- `number`: For numeric values
- `datetime`: For dates and times
- `reference`: For referring to other content types
- `slug`: For URL-friendly identifiers
- `object`: For grouping related fields together

#### Fetching Content in Next.js

To use content from Sanity in your Next.js pages, you need to use the Sanity client to fetch data:

1. First, set up a client file at `sanity/lib/client.js` (should already exist):

```javascript
import { createClient } from "next-sanity";

export const client = createClient({
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID,
  dataset: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET,
  apiVersion: "2023-05-03",
  useCdn: false,
});
```

2. Then, create a utility function to fetch data (e.g., in `sanity/lib/queries.js`):

```javascript
import { client } from "./client";

export async function getTeamMembers() {
  return await client.fetch(`*[_type == "teamMember"] | order(name asc)`);
}

export async function getTeamMemberBySlug(slug) {
  return await client.fetch(
    `*[_type == "teamMember" && slug.current == $slug][0]`,
    { slug },
  );
}
```

3. Use these functions in your Next.js pages or components:

```jsx
// app/team/page.js
import { getTeamMembers } from "@/sanity/lib/queries";
import Image from "next/image";
import { urlForImage } from "@/sanity/lib/image";

export default async function TeamPage() {
  const teamMembers = await getTeamMembers();

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      {teamMembers.map((member) => (
        <div key={member._id} className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          {member.image && (
            <Image
              src={urlForImage(member.image).url()}
              alt={member.name}
              width={300}
              height={300}
              className="rounded-full mx-auto"
            />
          )}
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">{member.name}</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600">{member.role}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Working with GROQ Queries

Sanity uses GROQ (Graph-Relational Object Queries) to query content. It's similar to SQL but designed specifically for structured content. Here are some common GROQ patterns:

```javascript
// Get all team members
*[_type == "teamMember"]

// Get all team members, ordered by name
*[_type == "teamMember"] | order(name asc)

// Get a specific team member by slug
*[_type == "teamMember" && slug.current == "john-doe"][0]

// Get team members with specific role
*[_type == "teamMember" && role == "Engineer"]

// Get only specific fields
*[_type == "teamMember"] { name, role, "imageUrl": image.asset->url }

// Get referenced content
*[_type == "project"] {
  title,
  "teamMembers": teamMembers[]->{ name, role }
}

// Limit results
*[_type == "blogPost"] | order(publishedAt desc)[0...5]
```

#### Image Handling with Sanity

Sanity provides an image URL builder to help transform and optimize images:

1. Ensure you have the `@sanity/image-url` package installed
2. Create a utility function in `sanity/lib/image.js`:

```javascript
import imageUrlBuilder from "@sanity/image-url";
import { client } from "./client";

const builder = imageUrlBuilder(client);

export function urlForImage(source) {
  return builder.image(source);
}
```

3. Use it in your components:

```jsx
import { urlForImage } from "@/sanity/lib/image";
import Image from "next/image";

// In your component:
{
  member.image && (
    <Image
      src={urlForImage(member.image)
        .width(300)
        .height(300)
        .fit("crop")
        .crop("focalpoint")
        .url()}
      alt={member.name}
      width={300}
      height={300}
    />
  );
}
```

Common image transformations:

- `.width(300)` - Set width
- `.height(300)` - Set height
- `.fit('crop')` - Crop to fit dimensions
- `.crop('focalpoint')` - Use focal point for cropping
- `.saturation(-100)` - Adjust saturation
- `.blur(10)` - Apply blur
- `.format('webp')` - Convert to WebP format

#### Content Versioning and Publishing

Sanity automatically tracks all content changes and provides a publishing workflow:

1. **Drafts**: When you create or edit content, it starts as a draft
2. **Publishing**: Click "Publish" to make content live
3. **History**: View all previous versions and who made changes
4. **Restore**: Roll back to a previous version if needed

#### Tips for Content Editors

1. **Use Live Preview**: See changes in real-time as you edit
2. **Organize with References**: Link related content together
3. **Use Validation Rules**: They help maintain content quality
4. **Utilize Custom Input Components**: For specialized content entry
5. **Collaborate**: Multiple people can work simultaneously

#### Best Practices

1. **Plan Your Content Model**: Think about content structure before implementation
2. **Use References**: Create relationships between content types
3. **Create Reusable Parts**: Use object types for content that appears in multiple places
4. **Consider Internationalization Early**: If you might need multiple languages
5. **Add Helpful Descriptions**: Help content editors understand fields
6. **Set Sensible Validation**: Ensure content quality without being too restrictive
7. **Use Arrays for Lists**: For repeatable content like FAQ items or features
8. **Use Portable Text**: For rich text instead of plain text when formatting is needed

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Content not showing up on the website**:

   - Check if it's published (not just saved as a draft)
   - Verify your query is correct
   - Check the project ID and dataset name in environment variables

2. **Images not loading**:

   - Make sure you're using the image URL builder correctly
   - Verify the image exists in Sanity

3. **Schema changes not appearing in Studio**:

   - Restart the development server
   - Make sure the schema is properly exported in the index file

4. **Error: "Failed to find document"**:
   - The content might be deleted or the ID is incorrect
   - Check your query parameters

### Basic React & Next.js Concepts

For team members new to React and Next.js, here's a beginner-friendly primer:

#### React Basics

React is all about components - reusable pieces of your website:

- **Components**: Think of these as custom LEGO pieces you create once and reuse everywhere
- **Props**: Information you pass to components (like arguments to a function)
- **State**: Data that can change over time (like a variable that remembers its value)
- **JSX**: HTML-like code written inside JavaScript (looks like HTML but has JavaScript superpowers)

Example of a simple React component:

```jsx
// This is a simple Button component
function Button({ text, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick} className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded">
      {text}
    </button>
  );
}

// How to use this Button in another component:
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <Button text="Click me!" onClick={() => alert("Button clicked!")} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example:

- We created a reusable Button component
- It accepts two props: `text` (what the button says) and `onClick` (what happens when clicked)
- We then used this Button in another component

#### Next.js Basics

Next.js makes it easy to create complete websites with React:

- **App Router**: File-based routing where each file in the `app` folder becomes a page on your website

  - For example, `app/about/page.js` becomes the `/about` page on your site

- **Pages**: Files named `page.js` that represent different pages of your website

  - Simple example: `app/page.js` is your homepage at '/'
  - Another example: `app/contact/page.js` is your contact page at '/contact'

- **Layout**: Shared elements that appear on multiple pages

  - Example: Header and footer that stay the same across pages

- **Server Components**: Components that run on the server (default in Next.js)

  - These are pre-rendered and sent to the browser as HTML
  - Good for content that doesn't need much interactivity

- **Client Components**: Components that run in the browser
  - Add `'use client'` at the top of the file to make it a client component
  - Good for interactive elements like forms and buttons

### Making Your First Code Change

Let's walk through a simple example of making a change to the homepage:

1. Open the file `app/page.js` in VS Code
2. Look for some text you want to change
3. Make your change and save the file
4. If the development server is running (`pnpm dev`), the browser will automatically refresh
5. See your change live in the browser!

Then, to save your change to Git:

```bash
# See what files you changed
git status

# Add the file you changed to staging
git add app/page.js

# Create a commit with a message describing your change
git commit -m "docs: update homepage welcome message"

# Push your changes to GitHub
git push
```

## Git Workflow

### What is Git?

Git is a version control system that helps teams work together on code:

- It keeps track of all changes to the code
- It allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work
- It maintains a history of who made what changes and when
- It enables you to create "branches" where you can work on new features without affecting the main code

Think of Git like a super-powered "Track Changes" feature in a word processor, but designed for code and with more capabilities.

### Basic Git Commands

Here are the essential Git commands you'll use regularly:

```bash
# Get the latest changes from the remote repository (GitHub)
git pull

# See what files you've changed
git status

# Add a specific file to be committed
git add filename.js

# Add all changed files
git add .

# Create a commit (a saved point in history) with a message
git commit -m "type: brief description of changes"

# Send your commits to GitHub
git push

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b branch-name

# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout branch-name

# See a list of all branches
git branch
```

### Branch Structure

Our repository has two main branches:

- **`main`**: The production branch containing stable, reviewed code. Only the team lead (admin) has direct push access.
- **`testing`**: The integration branch where all pull requests should be directed. After review and testing in this branch, changes will be merged into `main` by the team lead.

Think of it this way:

- `main` is like the published version of a book
- `testing` is like the final draft being reviewed by editors
- Your feature branches are like individual chapters being written

### Branching Strategy

We use a feature branch workflow:

1. Always create your feature branches from the latest `testing` branch:

   ```bash
   # Go to the testing branch
   git checkout testing

   # Get the latest changes
   git pull

   # Create a new branch for your feature
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   Use these prefixes for your branches:

   - `page/` for new pages (example: `page/about-page`)
   - `feature/` for new features (example: `feature/add-contact-form`)
   - `bugfix/` for bug fixes (example: `bugfix/fix-mobile-menu`)
   - `docs/` for documentation changes (example: `docs/update-readme`)
   - `refactor/` for code refactoring (example: `refactor/improve-navigation`)

2. Work on your feature, making regular commits (see [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines))
3. When your work is complete, push your branch and create a pull request to the `testing` branch (NOT to `main`)

**IMPORTANT: Never commit directly to `main` or `testing` branches! Always create a feature branch first.**

### Commit Guidelines

Write clear, concise commit messages that explain the "why" of your changes:

```
feat: add navigation component

Adds responsive navigation with mobile dropdown menu
```

Use these prefixes (this is called "Conventional Commits" style):

- `page:` for new pages
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

**Best Practices for Commits:**

- Commit frequently with small, logical changes rather than large commits
- Each commit should do ONE thing
- Make sure the code works before committing
- Write clear commit messages that explain WHY you made the change

Bad commit message: "Fixed stuff"
Good commit message: "fix: correct responsive layout on mobile devices"

### Pull Requests

When your feature is ready, it's time to create a Pull Request (PR). A PR is a request to merge your changes into the main codebase.

1. Before creating a PR, make sure your branch is up to date with the latest changes from `testing`:

   ```bash
   # Go to the testing branch
   git checkout testing

   # Get the latest changes
   git pull

   # Go back to your branch
   git checkout your-branch-name

   # Merge the latest testing changes into your branch
   git merge testing

   # If there are conflicts, resolve them (see the next section)

   # Push your updated branch to GitHub
   git push
   ```

2. Push your branch to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin your-branch-name
   ```

   The first time you push a new branch, you need the `-u origin` part. For subsequent pushes, you can just use `git push`.

3. Go to the repository on GitHub and create a new pull request:

   - Go to: https://github.com/INIABiosciences/inia
   - You should see a prompt to create a PR for your recently pushed branch
   - If not, click on "Pull requests" then "New pull request"
   - Set the **base** branch to `testing` (NOT `main`)
   - Set the **compare** branch to your feature branch
   - Click "Create pull request"

4. Fill in the PR template with details about your changes:

   - The template will automatically appear when you create a PR
   - Fill in all required sections:
     - Description: Brief summary of your changes
     - Related Issue: Link to the issue this PR addresses (use #issue-number)
     - Type of Change: Mark the appropriate option
     - How Has This Been Tested: Describe your testing approach
     - Screenshots: Add screenshots if applicable
     - Checklist: Make sure all items are checked off

5. Request reviews from team members
6. Address any feedback and make necessary changes
7. Once approved, your PR will be merged into `testing`
8. The team lead will periodically merge `testing` into `main` after thorough testing

> **Note:** We have PR templates set up to make this process easier. Just fill in the sections and submit your PR!

### Dealing with Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts happen when you and another team member change the same part of the same file. Git doesn't know which change to keep, so it asks you to decide.

When you see a message about merge conflicts, don't panic! Here's how to resolve them:

1. Open the file(s) with conflicts in VS Code
2. Look for sections marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`
3. The code between `<<<<<<<` and `=======` is YOUR change
4. The code between `=======` and `>>>>>>>` is the OTHER person's change
5. Edit the file to combine both changes or choose one over the other
6. Remove the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers
7. Save the file
8. Add the resolved file to Git: `git add filename.js`
9. Complete the merge: `git commit` (a commit message will be pre-filled)

Example of a conflict:

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD (your changes)
function greeting() {
  return "Hello, world!";
}
=======
function greeting() {
  return "Hi, everyone!";
}
>>>>>>> testing (their changes)
```

To resolve it, you might change it to:

```javascript
function greeting() {
  return "Hello, everyone!";
}
```

### Code Reviews

Code reviews are an essential part of our workflow:

- Focus on code quality, not personal preferences
- Check for:
  - Bugs or potential issues
  - Code clarity and maintainability
  - Adherence to project standards
  - Performance considerations
- Use GitHub's review features to comment on specific lines
- Approve the PR once you're satisfied with the changes

**For Reviewers:**

1. Look at the code changes carefully
2. Test the feature if possible
3. Provide constructive feedback
4. Suggest improvements, don't just criticize
5. Approve the PR if it meets the standards

**For Code Authors:**

1. Be open to feedback
2. Address all comments
3. Explain your decisions if you disagree
4. Make requested changes promptly
5. Thank reviewers for their time and input

## Code Standards

### Formatting and Linting

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistency. These tools run automatically when you commit code through Husky hooks, but you can also run them manually:

```bash
# Check for code issues
pnpm lint

# Format all files
pnpm format
```

**What these tools do:**

- **ESLint**: Checks for code quality issues and potential bugs
- **Prettier**: Formats code consistently (spacing, indentation, etc.)

Don't worry too much about memorizing all the rules. The tools will automatically check your code and tell you what needs to be fixed.

### Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for maintaining the project:

- Comment complex code sections
- Use JSDoc comments for functions when appropriate:
  ```javascript
  /**
   * Calculates the total price with tax
   * @param {number} price - The base price
   * @param {number} taxRate - The tax rate (e.g., 0.07 for 7%)
   * @returns {number} The total price including tax
   */
  function calculateTotal(price, taxRate) {
    return price * (1 + taxRate);
  }
  ```
- Keep README and other documentation up to date
- Document any non-obvious design decisions

**When to comment your code:**

- When the code does something complex or non-obvious
- When you use a workaround or unusual solution
- When there's important context that isn't clear from the code itself

**When NOT to comment:**

- Don't comment obvious things
- Don't write comments that just repeat what the code does
- Don't leave commented-out code in the final version

### Component Structure

For consistency, follow these guidelines for React components:

- One component per file
- Use descriptive, PascalCase names for component files (e.g., `NavigationBar.js`)
- Group related components in folders
- For complex components, split into smaller sub-components
- Use proper prop validation

Example of a well-structured component:

```jsx
// components/ui/Button.js
"use client";

/**
 * A reusable button component
 * @param {string} variant - The button style (primary, secondary, etc.)
 * @param {string} size - The button size (small, medium, large)
 * @param {function} onClick - Click handler function
 * @param {React.ReactNode} children - Button content
 */
export default function Button({
  variant = "primary",
  size = "medium",
  onClick,
  children,
}) {
  // Build class names based on props
  const classes = {
    primary: "bg-blue-500 text-white hover:bg-blue-600",
    secondary: "bg-gray-200 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-300",
    danger: "bg-red-500 text-white hover:bg-red-600",
    sizes: {
      small: "px-2 py-1 text-sm",
      medium: "px-4 py-2",
      large: "px-6 py-3 text-lg",
    },
  };

  return (
    <button
      className={`rounded ${classes[variant]} ${classes.sizes[size]} transition-colors`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Naming Conventions

Following consistent naming conventions makes code easier to understand:

- **Files and Folders**:

  - React components: PascalCase (`Button.js`, `NavigationBar.js`)
  - Utility functions: camelCase (`formatDate.js`, `apiHelpers.js`)
  - CSS modules: camelCase (`button.module.css`)

- **JavaScript**:

  - Variables and functions: camelCase (`userName`, `calculateTotal`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for true constants (`MAX_ITEMS`, `API_URL`)
  - Classes and React components: PascalCase (`UserProfile`, `Button`)
  - Boolean variables: prefixed with "is", "has", "should" (`isLoading`, `hasError`)

- **CSS Classes with Tailwind**:
  - Use the utility classes provided by Tailwind
  - For custom classes, use kebab-case (`user-avatar`, `nav-link`)

## Testing

### Manual Testing

For this project, we'll primarily rely on manual testing:

1. Test your feature thoroughly before submitting a PR
2. Test across different screen sizes for responsive design
3. Verify all interactive elements work as expected
4. Check for visual consistency with the design

Remember: Testing is everyone's responsibility! Don't assume someone else will catch your bugs.

### Testing Checklist

Before submitting a PR, go through this checklist:

- [ ] Does the feature work as expected?
- [ ] Does it look good on mobile devices? (Use browser dev tools to simulate different screen sizes)
- [ ] Does it look good on desktop?
- [ ] Does it work in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)?
- [ ] Are there any console errors?
- [ ] Is the code clean and following our standards?
- [ ] Is the UI consistent with the rest of the app?
- [ ] Are there any edge cases that might cause problems?

### Browser Compatibility

Ensure your code works on the following browsers:

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

You can test browser compatibility by:

1. Opening your local development server in different browsers
2. Using browser developer tools to test responsive designs
3. Checking for any JavaScript errors in the console

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

### CI Pipeline

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline automatically:

1. Runs on every push to `main` and `testing` branches
2. Runs on every pull request to `main` and `testing` branches
3. Performs the following checks:
   - Linting with ESLint
   - Format checking with Prettier
   - Checking for duplicate dependencies
   - Scanning for known vulnerabilities
   - Building the Next.js application
   - Reporting on bundle size
   - Running accessibility checks

This helps catch errors early and ensures code quality.

To see CI results:

1. After pushing your branch or creating a PR, go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Find your workflow run and check the results

If the CI checks fail, you'll need to fix the issues before your PR can be merged.

### Environments

We have two environments:

- **Development**: Your local environment for building features

  - This is what you run with `pnpm dev` on your computer
  - Changes here only affect your local copy

- **Production**: The live site (deployed from the `main` branch)
  - This is the public-facing website
  - Changes here affect all users

### Deployment Process

1. Changes are merged into `testing` branch through PRs
2. After thorough testing in the `testing` branch, changes are merged into `main` by the team lead
3. The team lead will handle deployment to production

As a team member, you don't need to worry about the deployment process. Just focus on getting your code into the `testing` branch through pull requests.

## Team Collaboration

### Communication

- **GitHub Issues**: Use for task tracking and bug reports

  - Create new issues for bugs you find
  - Claim issues you're working on
  - Use labels to categorize issues (bug, enhancement, etc.)

- **Pull Requests**: Use for code review and discussion

  - Link PRs to related issues
  - Tag relevant team members for review
  - Respond to feedback promptly

- **Discord**: Our primary communication platform

  - Join our team Discord server (link will be provided separately)
  - Check Discord daily for updates and announcements
  - Use appropriate channels for different topics:
    - `#general` - Team-wide announcements and discussions
    - `#help` - Ask questions when you're stuck
    - `#resources` - Share useful links and learning materials
    - `#random` - Off-topic conversations
  - Tag specific people with `@username` when needed
  - React to messages to acknowledge you've read them

- **Daily Bot**: We'll use a daily standup bot in Discord
  - The bot will prompt you once a day with three questions:
    1. What did you accomplish yesterday?
    2. What are you working on today?
    3. Are there any blockers in your way?
  - Everyone should respond to these prompts each weekday
  - This replaces the need for daily meetings and keeps everyone in sync
  - If you can't work on a particular day, just mention that in your response

### Agile Practices

Our team will follow Agile practices to manage the project efficiently:

#### Sprints

- We'll work in **3-class sprints**
- Each sprint will have specific goals and deliverables
- At the end of each sprint, we'll have working code to demonstrate

#### User Stories

- We'll break down requirements into user stories
- Format: "As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- Example: "As a site visitor, I want to see a contact form so that I can reach out to INIA"

#### Task Board

- We'll use GitHub Projects as our task board
- Tasks will move through these columns:
  - **Backlog**: Future tasks not yet scheduled
  - **To Do**: Tasks planned for the current sprint
  - **In Progress**: Tasks someone is actively working on
  - **Review**: Tasks waiting for code review
  - **Done**: Completed tasks

#### GitHub Issues

- We use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests
- We have issue templates set up to make creating new issues easier:
  - **Feature Request template**: For suggesting new features
  - **Bug Report template**: For reporting bugs

To create a new issue:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Issues" tab
3. Click "New Issue"
4. Select the appropriate template
5. Fill in the required information
6. Submit the issue

When working on an issue:

1. Assign it to yourself
2. Move it to "In Progress" on the task board
3. Create a branch related to the issue (use the issue number in the branch name)
4. Reference the issue in your commit messages (e.g., "fix: resolve #42")

#### Daily Standups

- Daily check-ins via Discord bot
- Answer three questions:
  1. What did you accomplish yesterday?
  2. What are you working on today?
  3. Are there any blockers in your way?
- Keep responses brief and focused

#### Sprint Meetings

- **Sprint Planning**: Beginning of sprint, assign tasks for the sprint
- **Sprint Review**: End of sprint, demo completed work
- **Sprint Retrospective**: End of sprint, discuss what went well and what could be improved

### How to Ask for Help

Everyone gets stuck sometimes. Here's how to ask for help effectively:

1. **Try to solve it yourself first**:

   - Google the problem
   - Check documentation
   - Look at similar code in the project

2. **Clearly describe the problem**:

   - What were you trying to do?
   - What happened instead?
   - What have you tried already?

3. **Share code/errors**:

   - Include relevant code snippets
   - Share exact error messages
   - Provide screenshots if relevant

4. **Use the right channel**:
   - Technical questions: Discord
   - Bugs: GitHub Issues
   - Design questions: Tag designers
   - Process questions: Ask the team lead

Example of a good help request:
"I'm trying to make the navigation menu responsive, but it's not collapsing on mobile. I've tried changing the CSS classes in NavigationBar.js (link to file). Here's what it looks like now (screenshot). The error I'm getting is: 'TypeError: Cannot read property 'toggle' of undefined'. Any ideas?"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

#### Node.js Issues

- **Error**: "node is not recognized as an internal or external command"

  - **Solution**: Make sure Node.js is installed and your PATH environment variable is set correctly. Try restarting your computer.

- **Error**: "This version of Node.js is not compatible with..."
  - **Solution**: Install the correct version of Node.js (v18 or later).

#### pnpm Issues

- **Error**: "pnpm is not recognized as an internal or external command"

  - **Solution**: Install pnpm globally: `npm install -g pnpm`

- **Error**: "Cannot find module..."
  - **Solution**: Run `pnpm install` again to make sure all dependencies are installed.

#### Next.js Issues

- **Error**: "Failed to compile"

  - **Solution**: Look at the error message for details, fix the indicated file.

- **Error**: "Port 3000 is already in use"
  - **Solution**: Either close the other application using port 3000, or use a different port: `pnpm dev -- -p 3001`

### Git Problems

#### Authentication Issues

- **Error**: "Authentication failed" when pushing/pulling
  - **Solution**: Make sure you're logged into GitHub and have the right permissions.

#### Merge Conflicts

- **Error**: "Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result"
  - **Solution**: Open the files with conflicts, resolve them manually, then commit.

#### Branch Issues

- **Error**: "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by X commits"

  - **Solution**: You need to push your changes: `git push`

- **Error**: "Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by X commits"
  - **Solution**: You need to pull the latest changes: `git pull`

### Code Problems

#### React Issues

- **Error**: "React Hook X is called conditionally..."

  - **Solution**: Move the hook outside of any conditional logic.

- **Error**: "Cannot update a component while rendering a different component"
  - **Solution**: Don't update state during rendering; move state updates to event handlers or useEffect.

#### Styling Issues

- **Problem**: CSS styles not applying

  - **Solution**: Check for typos in class names, make sure the CSS file is imported.

- **Problem**: Layout doesn't look right on mobile
  - **Solution**: Use responsive Tailwind classes like `md:`, `lg:` to adjust layout for different screen sizes.
