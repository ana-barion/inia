            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">🧬 Introduction: Framing the Science</h2>
            <p>
              Every day, millions of people suffer from chronic inflammatory conditions that disrupt their lives and strain healthcare systems. While medications can offer relief, they often come with trade-offs — from side effects to incomplete results.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Inia Bioscience, we believe there's a better way. The body's nervous system holds a powerful but often overlooked tool for regulating inflammation: the inflammatory reflex. By understanding and explaining this natural communication pathway, we aim to educate the public on how the body can be guided — not forced — to heal itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              This page introduces the science behind that process. Through research from across the field, and insights from neuromodulation pioneers, we explore how targeted signals through the vagus nerve could represent a more precise, more natural approach to managing inflammation.

            <p>
              The inflammatory reflex is a natural communication pathway between the nervous and immune systems. It acts like a circuit breaker for inflammation: when the body detects an immune response, the brain can send signals through the vagus nerve to help reduce excessive inflammation.
            </p>
            <p>
              This discovery has opened the door to a new field known as <strong>bioelectronic medicine</strong>, where devices can help modulate this reflex to support healing and restore balance in the body — without the need for traditional drugs.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">💡 Why It Matters</h2>
            <p><strong>[Image Placeholder: Illustration of inflammation in the body with a comparison between traditional pharmaceuticals vs. neural modulation. Suggested source: BioRender or Smart Servier Medical Art]</strong></p>
            <p>
              Chronic inflammation is a driving factor in many serious conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and even cardiovascular disease. Traditional treatments often rely on pharmaceuticals that can suppress the immune system or cause side effects over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              By targeting the inflammatory reflex, researchers have found a new way to regulate inflammation using the body's own neural pathways. This approach could offer more precise, less invasive treatment options — potentially transforming how we manage immune-related diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea isn’t science fiction. Clinical trials led by companies like <strong>SetPoint Medical</strong> have already shown promising results using implantable devices to stimulate the vagus nerve and reduce symptoms in autoimmune disorders.

            <p>
              The concept of modulating the inflammatory reflex has gained momentum in recent years, with a growing body of published research supporting its role in immune regulation. Scientists have explored how electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can lead to measurable reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines — key molecules involved in the body’s immune response.
            </p>
            <p>
              Several academic institutions and biotech firms, including SetPoint Medical, have pioneered early-stage trials in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Their findings continue to validate the therapeutic potential of neuromodulation-based approaches.
            </p>
            <p>
              These efforts demonstrate that targeting the body’s own neural circuits could represent a paradigm shift in how we treat inflammation-driven diseases — with less reliance on immunosuppressive drugs and greater precision in intervention.
